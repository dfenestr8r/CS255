Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass was a company seeking to develop a system that would help new drivers pass their DMV tests. They would offer online courses, practice tests, and on the road lesson reservations.

What did you do particularly well?

I think I did well with interpreting user needs and incorporating user stories into the overall system design.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the Limitations section of the business requirements document to add more detail and think more carefully about the limitations in the system and the process itself.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Most of the user needs came from an interview transcript with the Product Owner and some important members of the DriverPass team. Most functional and nonfunctional requirements were laid out explicitly, and it was just a matter of piecing them together in a coherent way that resembled the design of similar systems. The needs of the user are vital to designing a system that captures all of the functionality outlined by DriverPass and delivers the most value to customers.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

The most important approach for me is understanding the big picture idea of what the system needs to do and how it will be used before getting too deep into the details. I lost some progress due to not reading the transcript carefully and getting ahead of myself before realizing that changes needed to happen. In the future, I would begin with listing functional and nonfunctional requirements and creating process models to better understand the system as a whole.
